## A. tldr; of Kava Community arguments to lower the requested amount

1. Estimated TVL on Kava Co-Chains: $291M (Cosmos TVL: $274M, EVM TVL: $17M). So, the Cosmos TVL is much larger than the EVM TVL, which just recently started to develop. Kava Community members suggest that the request for past dev funding should be a % from the EVM chain TVL.
2. EVM support announcement did not make a difference in $KAVA price. From comment https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/xpll7c/comment/iqex4n6/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3:
> Kava price history:
> Aug 23, 2021 - $8.65 (ATH), mkt cap: $704M
> Aug 25, 2021 (Kava's EVM announcement based on your message) - $8.08, mkt cap: $657M
> Price range Aug 27, 2021 - today: $8.17 or lower
> Market cap range since Aug 25, 2021: ATH $1Bn (Apr 2022), low $337M (June 16, 2022)

* Note: $KAVA's highest price was on August 24:

## B. Kava Community suggestions:

> 666,666 kava (~$1M based on todayâ€™s price) with a linear vesting period of 6 months with following conditions for past development efforts. This funding can be in addition to future funding proposals for Ethermint.

## C. In turn, the Evmos Community & Tharsis can:
1. if you have proof of an even earlier date for the EVM support announcement by Kava to their investors, link it here and in the Reddit thread.
2. if you think the Evmos Community should lower their request, comment with the amount.
3. I have been told that Kava ran a liquidity program that diluted their $KAVA price. If you have something pertinent (with linked proofs) to comment about this, please do. Especially the date when the liquidity/dilution program started.
