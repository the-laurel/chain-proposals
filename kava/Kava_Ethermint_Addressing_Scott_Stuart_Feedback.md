# Addressing Previous Feedback from Kava Labs Co-Founder and CEO

The Evmos Community has taken into consideration @Scott_Stuart_'s [Twitter feedback](https://twitter.com/Scott_Stuart_/status/1563228443436728321). And it has separated the funding request for future Ethermint development from past development which $KAVA has already benefited from (image, branding, TVL, price).

The current Evmos Community request on behalf of Tharsis, for Ethermint past development efforts, done until September 1st 2022 [has been posted on Kava's Reddit on October 8th, 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/xyxr1o/prevotelast_version_ethermint_funding_proposal/). With an ask of 1.25M (1,250,000) $EVMOS ($KAVA amount TBD next Tuesday).

Kava's commitment to fund software meant to increase Kava's value is commendable. But there is a difference between projects built on Kava and projects that Kava is built upon. If the former should "reach out in Kava Discord", then, by the same standard, the later should be reached out by Kava on their own Discord.

Nontheless, @fekunze chose to demonstrate diplomacy and made the first step by [reaching out on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/wsa37v/evm_infrastructure_funding_proposal_on_kava/) and reaching out [on Kava's Discord](https://discord.com/channels/704389840614981673/704390145373372526/1011630510369427597)

We just published a community spend proposal to fund this critical EVM infrastructure. You can read more details about it by clicking the links below:

Kava's response was a rejection without any constructive offer. An invitation to reapply under uncertain terms that can conclude in another rejection is not constructive.

> 1.) Kava Infrastructure Security (KIS), if passed, is the perfect fit for Tharsis' request. In this case, funding from the community pool is strictly worse for $KAVA holders.

A KIS offer, based on per-block rewards may be suitable for on-going and future Ethermint development, that Kava will use. It may have been suited for past development, if @Scott_Stuart_ would have proposed this to Tharsis when they started using Ethermint. But a promise of future payment/installments cannot be a reward for past effort, unless a substantial increase in value is offered (similar to interest rates on a house). But this type of offer can only come from @kava_platform.
Therefore, the Evmos Community has done its duty and has valued Ethermint's past contribution to Kava at 1.25M $EVMOS, that Kava can fund from its Community Pool, as a one time payment under the recommendations presented in Kava's Reddit. This can serve for estimating Ethermint's value for a future KIS offer, if @kava_platform so wishes.

Same argument as point 1). KIS makes sense for on-going and future development, not for past development & value brought to the network.

You cannot change licensing on an already licensed product. The Ethermint version that Kava uses keeps its license in perpetuity. Regardless if Kava agrees or not to reward past development efforts of Ethermint, Kava has the right to continue using their current Ethermint version. 

The proposal for past development efforts is not concerned with future licensing. And the moral way is to fund what you have used and made substantial profit from.

A discussion about licensing can be found in the 3rd Evmos Governance Council meeting that was already linked in the proposal's description, at min 17:10: [https://youtu.be/PegeRNuK9F4?t=980](https://youtu.be/PegeRNuK9F4?t=980). Ethermint's future looks like software maintained by more than one actor and each actor may decide on how they license plugins/precompiles developed for Ethermint.
An actor that is non-profit, may impose additional restrictions to for-profit entities wanting to use their tech. If we want an open-source community with a diversity of interests, Tharsis may not want to impose an overall license.

Same answer as previous points. This is not a discussion about the future, but about substantial profits that the Kava Community and @Scott_Stuart_ have already pocketed, from using Ethermint as tech and the EVM branding/image.

If you want to fight for open-source and a for-profit permissive license, start by doing your duty to the projects that you have already used or plan to use: cosmos sdk, ethermint, go-ethereum, cosmwasm, etc. And if you have deep-enough pockets to offer open-source & permissive-license software for everybody, very good. I hope Kava DeFi tech will be used by many, doing good karma.
