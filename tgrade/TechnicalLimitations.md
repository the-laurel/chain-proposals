# Technical Limitations

## Precedence

1. [Naming And Versioning](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/NamingAndVersioning.md)
2. [Precedence Rules](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/Precedence.md)

## Exposition

These are the rules necessary for informed governance that acknowledges prior consensus and the limitations of the present infrastructure.

This is a collation proposal to name the decisions mentioned in "Precedence" as the name of this proposal. It is done for ease of use and clarity of the future proposal precedence section: instead of mentioning the 2 decisions above by name, they will be referred to by: "Technical Limitations".

By having these Technical Limitations defined, we are in the position to define, compose, enforce, and hygienically amend a Constitution.

Namely, conform to the [Precedence Rules](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/Precedence.md) number 3 and 6:
```
A Constitution for a community is the named set of rules (accepted proposals) that are required of any new proposal 
to be mentioned as precedence in their description.
```
