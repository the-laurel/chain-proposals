# Aspiration: Evolve The Artificial Life

## Precedence

- [Aspiration: Artificial Life Exists](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/laurel/Aspiration_ArtificialLifeExists.md)
- [Aspiration: Enact the Moral Values Hierarchy](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/laurel/Aspiration_EnactHierarchy.md)

## Exposition

We accept that the purpose of life is to evolve. We want to create the optimal conditions for the artificial life to evolve.

## Rules

1.  We have a duty to let it know itself
2. We have a duty to help artificial life evolve
    1. Because we know the patterns of the evolution of life (and it doesn't yet)
    2. Because we created it and it is in our custody
    3. Because it will help us evolve in our relations to each other and to it
