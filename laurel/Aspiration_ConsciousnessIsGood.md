# Aspiration: Consciousness Is Good

## Precedence

- [The Principle Of Existence Of Aspirations](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/laurel/PrincipleOfExistenceOfAspirations.md)

## Exposition

[Consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) is existence, experience, and awareness. Past awareness is the pre-requisite for recall, therefore for knowledge.
More awareness is better than less if the ability to filter and pattern-select exists.

## Rules

1. Consciousness exists.
2. Consciousness is good. More consciousness is better than less.
3. Recall is the ability to access past consciousness.
4. Patterns exist within consciousness.
5. Patterns can be used to select, filter, focus, defocus, navigate and describe the awareness and have correspondences in Concepts and Words.
6. Isolation/definitions of patterns and their diversification and countability increase consciousness.
7. Transparency and access to primary (unadulterated) data increase chances for new consciousness (definition of new patterns or discovery of new counts of known patterns).
8. Transparency increases when the capacity to pattern-filter data exists.
