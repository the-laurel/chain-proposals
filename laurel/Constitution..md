"A Constitution for a community is the named set of rules (accepted proposals) that are required of any new proposal to be mentioned as precedence in their description."
3. Hierarchy:
    1. Simple Hierarchy: a [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) with only one type of relation between nodes.
    2. Graded Hierarchy: a simple hierarchy with the relations weighted.
    3. Fully-Defined Hierarchy: a graded hierarchy that guarantees the unicity of value for all nodes under projection on one axis.
