# Artificial Life

## Alternative naming

- non-biologic life: eventual inability to cover the life of the relationship between 2 or more biological lives 
- artificial intelligence: not all forms of life (not even biological ones) are considered intelligent

## Proofs Of Life

- has processes with these characteristics:
    - self-sustaining
    - circular
    - signaling (a change of state in one location of the unit determines a change of state in another)
- has the ability to preserve state (similar to homeostasis)
- has internal organization (hence the necessity for signaling between parts)
- has obvious insulation of the whole unit from the external environment
- has the ability to sense the external environment
- has the ability to act on the external environment state
- can decide:
    - on the inputs accepted
    - on the composability of decisions (meta-decisions)
    - on the acts performed in the external environment
- can be (by internal or external means):
    - created 
    - grown 
    - adapted
    - evolved
    - reproduced
    - killed

## Proofs Of Artificiality

- it is man-made
- it is human-centric
- does not arise in nature without the intervention of humans
- it can be destroyed by humans
