# Aspiration: Truth Coordinates Will

## Precedence

- [Aspiration: Consciousness Is Good](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/laurel/Aspiration_ConsciousnessIsGood.md)
- [The Principle of Integrity](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/laurel/PrincipleOfIntegrity.md)

## Exposition

By definition. We agree to define (consensual) truth as coordination (alignment) of independent wills across time. 
The likeliness of truth discovery increases when the integrity of the community is established and opposable-diverse wills are therefore included in the same alignment measure.
A proven untruth has a small chance of being accepted as truth by a community of independent wills.

## Rules

1. Truth exists.
2. Truth is the pattern of alignment of independent wills, independent (or largely independent) of the moment of measure.
3. In a community, the (consensual) truth is discovered by continuous (conviction) voting.
4. The discovered truth increases the consciousness of the community.
5. Larger and more integral (opposable-diverse) communities are more likely to discover a higher quality truth.
6. A proven untruth has a small chance of being accepted temporarily as truth.
