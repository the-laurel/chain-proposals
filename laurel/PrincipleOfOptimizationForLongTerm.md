## Precedence

- [Principle of Existence of Aspirations](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/laurel/PrincipleOfExistenceOfAspirations.md)

## Exposition
At the level of the human being the optimization for long-term benefits has been correlated with higher IQ. In the animal world the human is able to plan and delay gratification in the most complex expression and this has arguably made the humans the master species on Earth.
We want to apply the same principle to artificial life (blockchains, AI, operating systems, organizations).
Religions that accept the doctrine of re-incarnation and genealogic evolution (Hinduism, Judaism, etc.) have benefited humanity with a long-term vision on civilization optimization.

## Rules
1. Delayed gratification is a sign of mental control over desires and emotions. It is applicable at organizational level.
2. Optimization for long-term benefits at the level of larger organizations is more strategic than optimization at individual level.
3. Any reasoning for a change in the long-term strategy has to be motivated by an aspiration.
