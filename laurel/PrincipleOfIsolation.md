# The Principle of Isolation

## Precedence

- [The Existence of (Governance) Principles](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/laurel/ExistenceOfPrinciples.md)

## Exposition

Since there are differences in cultures, upbringing, education amongst the voters in Governance, the facts and the relevant precedent decisions of that Governance has to be considered when making a decision for a proposal.
They have to be considered in as great an isolation as possible from off-chain interference as well as on-chain irrelevant history and proposals in the scope of the present decision.

## Rules

1. Only the relevant on-chain decisions shall be used as governance precedence
2. No off-chain information or additional content shall be used unless present in the official discussion of the proposal
3. The official discussion shall exist, linked in the proposal text, be public and available to any voter both to read, comment, and answer comments at least for the entire period of voting
4. The discussion should be considered as part of the proposal data and be archived and at least available as read-only resource for the lifetime of the chain
