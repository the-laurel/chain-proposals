## Exposition

[A principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle) is a proposition or value that is a guide for behavior or evaluation. It is definable, atemporal, and generally valid. Its application to circumstances should be computable.

The governance principles are patterns that exist across domains. They can use the Precedence Rules to be visualized, but they are more pervasive than other proposals that are part of the graph in the sense that every proposal is considered as being silently dependent upon them.

Principles are for governance what oracle-originating information is for the blockchain. They are pieces of important information that come from other domains like Discrete Mathematics or Philosophy in order to be part of the governance infrastructure.

This first principle is axiomatic and proposes the existence of principles (including itself).

## Rules

1. (Governance) Principles exist.
2. Some principles are axioms (cannot be deduced from priors)
3. Principles are:
    1. definable
    2. perpetual
    3. unrestricted by space
    4. generalized: unrestricted by a specific domain
    5. deterministic: their application is the same under the same circumstances
    6. usually atomic
    7. with a short precedence path (usually only this principle)
4. Even without being explicitly mentioned: all governance proposals (causally) depend upon all accepted principles.
5. Because they are perpetual, principles have pseudo-retroactive effects (not by changing history, but by implicit/reflex introduction of amendments) where this is permitted by the Governance Infrastructure.
