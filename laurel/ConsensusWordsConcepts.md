# Consensus on Words and Concepts
https://commonwealth.im/laurel/discussion/6610-metameta-consensus-on-words-and-concepts

Words are a form of cached consensus between individuals/groups and the larger society.

Consensus on words and concepts (since they serve as cache) should be next to impossible to overturn. Concepts (synsets in the Princeton WordNet) are timeless. The concepts are the [Socratic Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms). Pre-established consensus on the link between a concept and the word that signifies it should be timeless as well. Since this consensus existed before the present voters' lives, people who are not alive today are also entitled to vote on any "change of meaning" proposals. Such a vote is impossible to implement. As an alternative: local (restricted to a community) consensus on temporary slang can be achieved. But slang should not be used in governing public blockchains.

## Conclusions

1. For Chain Governance, we will use only the English language.
1. We will consider in the English language the words and concepts (synsets) covered by (that contain their lemma (for words) or their gloss (for concepts)) the [Princeton WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) for English, plus [prepositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preposition_and_postposition),Â [determiners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determiner), and [function words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_word).
1. If a word or concept is not included in (2), we can accept the words and concepts covered by the [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org).
1. Local definitions of words and/or concepts will be accepted (each by its own gov proposal) only if the words or concepts are not covered by the sources at (2) and (3), and they are required for correct governance. If they are neologisms, their lemma will be updated in governance texts according to (2) and (3) as soon as those sources get to contain the words or/and concepts.
1. **The exact link between words and concepts is not required for each word of a gov proposal, but the links have to be resolved by the proposer for each and every challenge (in the off-chain proposal discussions) of the meaning of a word or punctuation sign that may substantially change the global meaning of any gov proposal.**
