# Naming And Versioning

## Precedence

- [Governance Infrastructure](https://commonwealth.im/laurel/discussion/6708-metameta-governance-infrastructure)
- [Precedence Rules](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/laurel/Precedence.md)

## Exposition

A title/name for each proposal is necessary so the entire text of the proposal can be tersely referenced.
A version is necessary in cases the proposal is amended and for precedence qualifications.

## Rules

1. Titles/names of proposals have to be unique.
2. Names should be as short as possible without taking away concept estate from eventual future proposals.
3. Versions are the last block number (height) just before the moment the proposal is committed.
4. No proposal can be dependent (by precedence) on decisions with greater version numbers than themselves.
