# The Principle of Identity

## Precedence

- [The Existence of (Governance) Principles](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/laurel/ExistenceOfPrinciples.md)

## Exposition

Identity is of two types: individual and group. We will reduce the exposition to the individual case because the group identity has to obey the same rules, at the group level. Therefore it is the same principle, applied to groups.
The identity is a signifier (the way words are for concepts) for a unique entity (that is signified). It is gained by consensus of the community that needs to refer to the signified.

## Rules

1. The community that creates identities is defined as a set of entities with previously-created identities.
2. An identity is created by consensus within the community.
3. An identity string should:
  1. be relatively short
  1. guarantee a timeless relation to the identified
  1. guarantee a unique relation to the identified
4. A change of the identity means assuming the new identity string from the moment of the change and the right to add the new identity string to previous documentation where possible (but not the right to delete the old identity).
5. Equivalence
  1. Two entities are equal if they are in fact the same. Their identities have to be equal too.
  2. Two entities are equivalent if their group identities are equal.

## Obvious Applications

- application of justice
- determination of role and responsibility
