We, the developers of the Mythos chain stand together for Justice. We expect Justice to be served by the appropriate institutions only.

This is a link with most official info about the case (if you find a better public source: we will update it):

We consider prop #793 as:
1) a violation of Article 10 from the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights)
> Article 10
> Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.
2) an attempt at [Obstruction of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice) using the blockchain as an instrument. This act falls under Criminal Law in most developed countries and blockchain governance should not have allowed such acts in principle.

When we volunteered for the Evmos chain, we proposed the chain adopt this principle by:

Such a proposal should be passed by each Cosmos chain in order to have a moral and legal Governance.

The developers of the Mythos chain want Justice to be served for Grace Yu @YuTangClan_ and @Allinbits_inc
