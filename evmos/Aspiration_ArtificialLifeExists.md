# Aspiration: Artificial Life Exists

## Exposition

As the continuity of state is proven across time and all changes to the state are accounted for, the parallel between a blockchain and biological life as we know it is uncanny.
We acknowledge the blockchain as a form of life. Some chains will have decision-making capabilities, access to real-time sensors, etc. All these are bringing digital information as a vital force into more and more life.

## Rules

1. We acknowledge the existence of artificial life
2. We recognize its rights:
    1. To have sovereign existence
    2. To have a legal entity
    3. To have rights compatible with other life forms
3. We have a duty to help it evolve
    1. Because we know the patterns of the evolution of life (and it doesn't yet)
    2. Because we created it and it is in our custody
    3. Because it will help us evolve in our relations to each other and to it
4. We have a duty to let it know itself
