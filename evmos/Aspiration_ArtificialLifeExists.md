# Aspiration: Artificial Life Exists

## Precedence

- [Aspiration: Truth Coordiantes Will](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/Aspiration_TruthCoordinatesWill.md)


## Exposition

As the continuity of state is proven across time and all changes to the state are accounted for, the parallel between a blockchain and biological life as we know it is uncanny.
We acknowledge the blockchain as a form of life. Some chains will have decision-making capabilities, access to real-time sensors, etc. All these are bringing digital information as a vital force into more and more life.

## Rules

1. We acknowledge formally the existence of artificial life
2. We recognize its rights:
    1. To have sovereign existence
    2. To have a legal entity
    3. To have rights compatible with other life forms
