## The Natural Language for the Governance of the Evmos Chain is English

Discussion: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7850-common-sense-setting-no-payment-for-unsolicited-services](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7850-common-sense-setting-no-payment-for-unsolicited-services)

### Purpose
Clarify the parameters for natural language on-chain Governance.

### Exposition

To achieve authority of Governance, the chain needs to establish the most accessible ground for debate and voting. The language for the process of Governance is one of the main parameters and we consider that the best language for Evmos Governance is the English language.
Since the meaning of the sentence and therefore paragraph can be changed by word meaning choice, by the punctuation signs, and by the resultant syntax tree, a consensus has to be reached on the unique arbiter for each, including the syntax tree of a proposal (in whole or in part).

### Rules
1. The accepted English dictionary for words and concepts and their semantic linking shall be the latest version of The Princeton Wordnet. http://www.lexvo.org/uwn/ with language option English (eng).
2. If concepts are not found in the source designated by point (1): Wikipedia may be used. https://en.wikipedia.org/
3. The syntax tree source shall be [http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/](http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/) with its English option.

### Meaning of Your Vote (Or Lack Thereof)
This proposal is binary:
- voting YES means support
- not voting, voting NO, NO with VETO or Abstain means that you accept other natural languages in the Governance process.

If this proposal does not pass: the token holders forfeit the moral right to reject a proposal on account of not being made in English.

If the proposal passes: the subsequent proposals may be challenged on:
- the natural language used
- clarifying the meaning of a specific word
- sources of truth (such as a unique dictionary)
- syntax or semantic ambiguities
