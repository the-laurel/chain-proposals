## The Natural Language for the Governance of the Evmos Chain is English

Discussion: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8551-governance-consensus-the-governance-language-is-english](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8551-governance-consensus-the-governance-language-is-english)

### Purpose

Clarify the parameters for natural language on-chain Governance.

### Exposition

To achieve authority of Governance, the chain needs to establish the most accessible ground for debate and voting. The language for the process of Governance is one of the main parameters and we consider that the best language for Evmos Governance is the English language.

Since the meaning of the sentence and therefore paragraph can be changed by word meaning choice, by the punctuation signs, and by the resultant syntax tree, a consensus has to be reached on the unique arbiter for each, including the syntax tree of a proposal (in whole or in part).

### Rules

1. The accepted English dictionary for words and concepts and their semantic linking shall be the latest version of The Princeton Wordnet. http://www.lexvo.org/uwn/ with language option English (eng).

2. If concepts are not found in the source designated by point (1): Wikipedia may be used. https://en.wikipedia.org/

3. The syntax tree source shall be [http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/](http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/) with its English option.

### Meaning of the Decision

- if this proposal passes: the governance process gains additional legitimacy by recognizing prior consensus contained in the gov language itself

- if this proposal does not pass: the token holders forfeit the right to reject a proposal (on-chain or off-chain) on account of not being made in proper, verifiable English

#### Additional Benefits of Adopting
The subsequent proposals (on and off-chain) may be legitimately challenged on:

- the natural language used
- clarifying the meaning of a specific word
- sources of truth (such as a unique dictionary)
- syntax or semantic ambiguities

Only the chains that will pass proposals compatible with this one will have the legitimacy to enter common governance platforms for the InterChain. By this prop, we offered Evmos the opportunity to be the early leader in that respect.
