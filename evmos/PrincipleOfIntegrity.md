## Exposition

Moral integrity is achieved by illuminating the whole context of a situation and only the relevant context, as determined by reason. If there is an imbalance in the sense of lack of reaction or lack of proper transformation, reparatory actions have to be introduced in context until moral integrity is attained.

## Rules

1. blockchain transactions of only one nature and in only one direction are decreasing the integrity
2. complementary transactions or transactions in the opposite direction are increasing the integrity
3. off-chain transactions should also be considered when judging the integrity
4. the domain (including both directions) of the context has to be limited by relevancy (and by demonstration of relevancy)
5. transparency increases the chance to achieve integrity (but does not guarantee it)

## Obvious Applications

- application of justice
- determination of the integrity
- determination of domains of transaction
