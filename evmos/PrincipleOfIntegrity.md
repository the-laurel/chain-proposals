# The Principle of Integrity (of Context)

## Precedence

- [The Principle of Transformation

## Exposition

Moral integrity is achieved by illuminating the whole context of a situation. If there is an imbalance in the sense of lack of reaction or lack of proper transformation, reparatory actions have to be introduced in context until moral integrity is attained.

## Rules

1. blockchain transactions of only one nature and in only one direction are decreasing integrity
2. complementary transactions or transactions in the opposite direction are increasing the integrity
3. off-chain transactions should also be considered when judging integrity

## Obvious Applications

- application of justice
- determination of integrity
