**Loredana's (evmos4volunteers, The Laurel Project) proposal for Evmos:**
"Continue my volunteer work on EVM Inter-Chain, by formalizing the protocols, creating new inter-chain standards (like we started with IC_ERC20, IC_ERC721), extending nBridge for CosmWasm (EVM <-> CosmWasm nBridge).
For this work to have a chance of adoption, I need to be close to Evmos, Cosmos, Interchain Foundation & other Cosmos blockchain teams. And the best location for me to influence the future tech for the benefit of the Evmos blockchain is Berlin. I would personally like to continue my work remotely and transparently (e.g. github, videos), but I found that it is very hard for other people to collaborate without face-to-face meetings.
**The Evmos community would only sponsor my rent in Berlin (apartment + office), effectively sponsoring my lobby services, for the benefit of Evmos. My tech effort will remain a volunteer contribution, unpaid.**

## Why should Evmos sponsor lobbying?
Because a multi-chain standard (like I am proposing) requires a controller chain to have a correct state view. This controller chain can be Evmos. See my 2 HackATOM videos: https://youtu.be/j5CVliOb-Ck and https://youtu.be/Khqv-1TbsMo .
"

In Berlin, Loredana would be available for technical conferences for the benefit of Evmos.

## Why is Loredana Cirstea the best person for the job?
* previous volunteering efforts for Evmos: https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/tree/master/evmos
* has live the only cutting edge chains where you can test inter-chain and multi-chain EVM transactions: https://github.com/the-laurel/demos
* HackAtom Seoul participation: https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/master/evmos/events/1.2022-07_HackAtom.md
* https://loredanacirstea.medium.com/nbridge-inter-chain-erc20-and-how-to-not-get-rekt-by-bridges-unique-assets-shared-security-43f728f05552
* has done many prototypes and demos demonstrating innovations on Evmos, some live on Mythos.

## Expenses estimate:
- office: https://www.fullnode.berlin/membership/, FIXED DESK, everyday. 490 â‚¬ / month.
- rent: ~2500 â‚¬ / month (finding an apartment for less than 1 year is more costly; account for EVMOS price instability)
- TOTAL: 2000 EVMOS / month. Any remaining money can be used for tech or diplomatic purposes (conference expenses, coffee meetings with tech influencers)
- expenses and output will be tracked transparently [at this link](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/master/evmos/events/2.2022_08_EvmosCommunityLobbySponsorship.md), as [was done for HackAtom](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/master/evmos/events/1.2022-07_HackAtom.md#expenses)

## Deliverables:
- at the end of each month, a detailed list of output [will be on GitHub](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/master/evmos/events/2.2022_08_EvmosCommunityLobbySponsorship.md)
- for the first 3 weeks the EVM Inter-Chain standards for the most popular EVM standards will be penned

## Timeline:
- sponsorship is paid 3 months in advance, every three months until the Evmos community decides to stop it.
- this proposal is only made for 6 months (12000 EVMOS), to give the community a chance to re-vote based on output.

## Multisig Signatories
2 out of 3 signatories for multisig execution is proposed:
- Tricky | Cosmos Spaces â˜®ðŸ’œâš› 
- Outcast | Legion Nodes
- LPX 

## Abstain
The evmos4volunteers and votes4volunteers validators will vote Abstain on this proposal.
