## Precedence

- [Aspiration: Truth Coordinates Will](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/Aspiration_TruthCoordinatesWill.md)
- [The Principle of Integrity](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/PrincipleOfIntegrity.md)

## Exposition

Because monotheistic religions exist and they were tenable across ages, we have to recognize the likely reality that there is only one true hierarchy of moral values.
Our deepest aspiration is to discover the details of this objective truth and act according to it.

## Rules

1. There is a unidimensional axis of moral values.
2. Each action has its unique placement on this axis.
3. The deepest aspiration of the intelligent being is to discover it.
