# How to centralize a chain by manipulating Cosmos Governance

1. Pass a proposal that requires future proposals to comply with an exact process
2. Introduce in said process an inconspicuous step that may be centrally-controlled
3. Done!

That has been done in Evmos Governance and it works:
1. https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83 was passed that contained a lot of text. 
2. One of the paragraphs [there](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md#2-the-ecp-lifecycle) reads: 
> #### Phase 1: Discussion & Ideation | Min. 48 hours | Forum Tag: [IDEATION]
> The purpose of this phase is to vet ideas with the active Evmos community members. Each idea for a proposal should have its own Commonwealth thread, and discussions should be as narrowly focused as possible.
3. Now there is an unknown actor, not elected by the chain, who deletes or hides from the public the proposal threads from https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussions, therefore nobody may be able to propose anything that is not in line with the will of that actor. Conclusion: who moderates the Evmos Commonwealth fully controls Evmos Governance.

This can happen to your chain too..

## Solutions

- momentarily: the governance process decided by the Evmos chain cannot be trusted. Nor any of the accounts presently controlled by actors who were not elected by the chain itself. We appeal to the greater Cosmos Community to let proposals for Evmos be discussed on Cosmos Reddit until this is remedied
- long term: we will propose this: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8698-governance-consensus-only-elected-officers-may-represent-the-will-of-the-chain if it will be deleted: https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/315206646f169c18bbab0c70702865cbdf479c3f/evmos/OnlyOfficers.md so only executive officers elected by the chain have the power to fulfill chain's decisions
