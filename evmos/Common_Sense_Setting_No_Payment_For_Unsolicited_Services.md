# Common Sense Setting: No Payment For Unsolicited Services

# No Payment For Unsolicited Services

Purpose: achieve moral independence from services that are not solicited by the chain.

Do not solicit retroactive payment for services/products from the Evmos Community Treasury if those services/products and payment amounts were not agreed upon, voted and passed through Evmos's governance process.

This is not precluding people from giving their services to the chain, without being paid (as a volunteer).

## Exceptions

1. force majeure situations in which the service proposal cannot be done through normal governance process (e.g. chain halt)
2. emergency situations (e.g. hack event)
3. services done for the Evmos chain before this proposal, can be retroactively paid if a Community Treasury proposal is made before three months pass from the date this proposal is passed on-chain. Once the three month deadline is passed, no other retroactive payment is owed by the Evmos chain.
