# (English) Grammar and Syntax Tree

- discussion: [(English) Grammar and Syntax Tree]([https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6610-metameta-consensus-on-words-and-concepts](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6690-metameta-english-grammar-and-syntax-tree)

## Precedence

This proposal recognizes as precedent:
1. [(English) Words and Concepts](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6610-metameta-consensus-on-words-and-concepts)

## Exposition

Since the meaning of the sentence and therefore paragraph can be changed by word meaning choice, by the punctuation signs and by the resultant syntax tree, a consensus has to be reached on the arbiter for the syntax tree of a proposal (in whole or in part).

## Rules

1. The syntax tree arbiter service has to be unique and its output deterministic.
2. The syntax tree provider has to be accepted by the governed community and by the proposer (of a new proposal).
3. One such service is available at http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/ with its English option. We accept it as present canonical source of truth.
4. Together with the precedent (1), this set can be reffered to as: "(English) Language Limitations"
