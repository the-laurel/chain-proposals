# The Principle of Continuity of State

## Precedence

- [The Existence of (Governance) Principles](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/ExistenceOfPrinciples.md)

## Exposition

This is a generalization of Newton's [First Law of Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion) that reads:
"Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it."
The blockchain is a mechanism that guarantees that the state is preserved continuously in time and space unless a provable transformation (transaction) changes it explicitly. The same principle applies to governance.

## Rules
1. A state is any digitally representable value or combination of values that is part of the governable system.
2. A state changes only if a provable transformation changes it explicitly.
3. A state is preserved continuously in time and space (across devices).
