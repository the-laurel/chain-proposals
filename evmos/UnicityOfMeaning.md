# Unicity of Meaning

## Exposition

A text in natural language may have several meanings due to words pointing to more than one concept, syntax, punctuation, cultural trends, and biased understanding. A source code may also have several ways of execution depending on the parser or interpreter version. This is a set of rules to mitigate these limitations.

## Rules

1. A proposal can be written in textual form in several paragraphs.
2. Any paragraph of text has to identify one (unique) language for its interpretation (be it natural or computer language).
3. Every paragraph should have only one meaning. This should be achieved especially if the proposal refers to significant assets.
4. No two paragraphs may contradict each other. If a paragraph is repeating in computer language something that another paragraph describes in natural language, the rendering has to be faithful to the meaning of the natural language.
5. If a text is translated into multiple languages, it has to identify the pre-eminent language in each of its translations (with a link to the original).
