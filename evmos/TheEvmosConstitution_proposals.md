# The Evmos Constitution

_As proposed in https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6082-ideation-the-evmos-constitution?comment=27823_

I make the following amendments to empower the decentralization, transparency, and censorship-resistant values that Evmos wants to embody:

## Point (1) for `2. Guiding Principles`:

> 2. Neutrality and Non-Partisanship: No one group or community member should be favored over any other members. We believe in the principles of equality for all and must act in accordance with this core principle.
>

I agree with the essence of the above. But the statement can be ambiguous because "favor" is not precisely defined. It should be clearer that "favor" implies "nepotism", and "cronyism", meaning "benefits" given based on personal, private, and social relationships.

Therefore, I suggest the text be:

**2. Neutrality and Non-Partisanship: We believe in the principles of equality for all and must act in accordance with this core principle. All groups and community members have equal access to information, equal rights, and equal responsibilities, as defined by this Constitution. No one group or community member should be favored over any other members. No one group or community member should be disfavored over any other members. We define "favor" as an unfair benefit that is not a direct consequence of provable effort and actions done, in alignment with Evmos's mission and goals. We define "disfavor" as an unfair punishment or loss of opportunity that is not a direct consequence of provable actions done against Evmos's mission and goals.**



## Point (2) for `3. Community Code of Conduct`

The Code of Conduct has no place in the Constitution. It should be a different document, in the same way as the Governance Framework is. It should have its roots in the Constitution, but not the body.

If you decide that the Constitution will not include it, then it must include information about the form of the COC: member roles, how are they appointed, who can establish COC rules, and how.

If you decide that the Constitution will include it, then here are my amendments:

After the paragraph:

> 3. Community Code of Conduct
> Rights - Community moderators and core team members reserve the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that are excessively inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

I suggest adding:

**Rights - Stating provable facts is not a reason for banning. Stating provable lies can be a reason for banning.**


**Responsibilities - The list of existing moderators must be public to the Evmos Community. Entities with the above rights have the responsibility to create and maintain publicly accessible proofs (screenshots, Internet Archive links, etc.) for cases where they decide to delete, ban or remove a contributor's post, PR, issue, or other output. In such cases of banning/removing content, where the contributor has either a disclosed identity or a track record of contributions, moderators must prove the reasoning for their ban/removal. Contributors have the right to prove their viewpoint by having access to the content, discussion, etc. that produced the ban/removal.**

**Election - Community moderators can be chosen or revoked through an on-chain Governance Proposal. The details for the process will be expanded on in the Governance Framework.**

**Capital Punishment**
**- The capital punishment for entities who have disclosed their identity (or are willing to do so) and have proven contributions, is in line with Evmos's mission and goals. As enacted by moderators, it is a temporary ban on writing in 1 or more channels, of up to 6 months, for repeated offenses. There is no ban on viewing channels and no restriction to community-public information. Such bans can be resolved as a last resort by on-chain governance if the off-chain resolution was attempted unsuccessfully. Capital punishment, as enacted by on-chain Governance can result in a permanent writing ban.**

**Punishment Reflexivity: If a moderator's decision to ban a contributor is overturned, the overturned ban may apply to the moderator and involved parties responsible for the ban/removal.**


## Point (3) for `1. Evmos Governance Framework`

The Constitution must establish the roots of the Governance Framework. Including how Governance Framework members are chosen or removed. Given that the Governance Framework is the liaison between the Community and Evmos Foundation and it will be the body that regulates how the Community makes decisions, the Community must have the right to appoint or revoke the Governance Framework Members. This is part of the mechanism that makes Evmos censorship-resistant.

Therefore, I propose the following be added:

**We will define "envoys" as Governance Framework members.
The list of existing envoys must be public to the Evmos Community.
Envoys must be ratified individually, by a Community Governance vote on-chain. The Evmos Community can propose and vote to add or remove envoys. The guidelines for the proposal and voting process will be expanded on in the Governance Framework itself.**



## Point (4) Additional questions:
4.1. Are Envoys employees of the Evmos Foundation / Tharsis or any other company behind the Evmos blockchain? Are Envoys required to be employees or can they be independent parties?
4.2. Are community moderators employees of the Evmos Foundation / Tharsis or any other company behind the Evmos blockchain? Are moderators required to be employees or can they be independent parties?

The answers to these questions should be in the Constitution if there is a limitation on who can be a member of the above groups.
