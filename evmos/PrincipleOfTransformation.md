# The Principle of Transformation

## Precedence

- [The Existence of (Governance) Principles](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/ExistenceOfPrinciples.md)

## Exposition

The process of transforming a cause into its effects has a quantitative mapping.
In voting, the number of tokens owned or delegated to you constitutes your voting power. This is a mapping of 1:1 or equivalence.
In currency exchanges the mapping is pseudo-linear: when some amount x of coin A is exchanged with amount y of coin B, the amount y of coin B may be exchanged for the initial amount x of coin A. And a 2x of coin A will buy 2y of coin B. This is called proportional.
In quadratic voting the transformation is quadratic.

## Rules
1. When resource A is moved or copied into another resource B, the obtained measure of B is deterministically-dependent on the input measure of A.
2. The exact formula of the transformation function is determined by the natures of A and B and their relationship.
3. Relationships:
    1. When A and B have *exactly* the same nature the transformation is of type move and the formula is equivalence (1:1) example: fungible tokens of the same kind are equivalent to each other.
    2. When A and B have almost the same nature: move, proportional.


## Obvious Applications

1. Voting
2. Currency exchanges
3. Application of justice
