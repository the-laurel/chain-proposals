# Governance Consensus: Only Elected Officers May Represent the Will of the Chain

Discussion: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8698-governance-consensus-only-elected-officers-may-represent-the-will-of-the-chain](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8698-governance-consensus-only-elected-officers-may-represent-the-will-of-the-chain)

## Will Evmos Choose Its Own Executives?

If this proposal passes: Evmos governance decisions may be implemented by legitimate elected officers.

If this proposal does not pass: until the rejection is overturned, the Evmos chain may be represented by anybody and/or nobody.



## Advantages of Adopting

Non-exhaustive list of what is obtained, improved, or encouraged by passing this proposal:
- provide transparency of:
    - power structure
    - actions done for the benefit of the chain
- provide evidence of decentralization
- clarify the assignment of responsibility
- welcome cooperation with other chains
- obtain delegation of representation
- expand the types of actions the chain can govern
- legitimize legal representation
- legitimize officers using the chain itself (increased independence of legitimacy)


## Measures

1. Only officers elected by on-chain governance may implement the decisions of the chain in the name of the chain.
2. Offices must be concretely defined and created via on-chain governance before nomination and election of each respective office occurs. 
3. Officers must not exceed their jurisdiction (as defined by on-chain governance above).
4. Public and private communication channels, with open-door policies, must be concretely defined for each office.
5. All offices, their enacting officers and communication channels must be publicly available.
