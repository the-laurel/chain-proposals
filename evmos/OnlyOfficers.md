# Governance Consensus: Only Elected Officers

Discussion: 

## Rules

1. Only officers elected by on-chain governance may implement the decisions of the chain in the name of the chain.
2. The officers shall not exceed the jurisdiction nor the described intent of their offices.
3. The definition of offices is done by on-chain governance, prior to nominalizations and officer election for each office.

## Meaning of the Decision

- if this proposal passes: the Evmos Chain may implement on-chain governance decisions by using legitimate human executives
- if this proposal does not pass: the Evmos chain may be represented by anybody and/or nobody

Only the chains that will pass proposals compatible with this one will have the legitimacy to enter common governance platforms for the InterChain. By this prop, we offered Evmos yet another opportunity to be the early leader in that respect.
