# Retroactive Payment for Public Goods (Evmos Development for 2022)


Discussion: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8811-retroactive-payment-for-public-goods-evmos-development-for-2022](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8811-retroactive-payment-for-public-goods-evmos-development-for-2022)

tl;dr
Same as [proposal 95](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/95), accounting for the rest of 2022.

Since [proposal 88](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/88) has been rejected, the volunteers for Tharsis and Evmos will have the opportunity to ask the Evmos chain for clarification of the status of their efforts.

## Exposition

The for-profit developers of Tharsis were paid by salary for their development work. Then Tharsis extracted tens of millions of dollars from the apparent value of the Evmos chain to pay themselves again.

The Laurel Project which volunteered for Tharsis for developing a good portion of the Evmos chain tech and some Ethermint coding will also ask the Evmos Community if their efforts will be accepted in perpetuity as volunteering or if they will be paid as retroactive public goods funding.

## Proofs

* 1. The proof that the output of the effort exists as a public good: the videos exist and are public on YouTube, and the code exists and is public.
* 2. The proof that it is about the Evmos chain/tech: the code is used by Ethermint/Evmos.
* 3. The proof that the effort is of the quality and quantity claimed: Tharsis signed the confirmations for the effort, as comments on:
  * [https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/1](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/1)
  > I confirm and acknowledge the stated output. Thanks @loredanacirstea for your hard work and dedication!
  > Federico Kunze Küllmer - CEO Tharsis Labs / Co-Founder Evmos
  > Fri, Mar 25, 2022, by [@fedekunze](https://github.com/fedekunze)
  * [https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/3](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/3)
  > Federico Kunze Küllmer - Evmos / Tharsis. I confirm that the statement above is accurate.
  > On a personal note: thanks @loredanacirstea for all your effort and dedication. You're not only a great EVM engineer but also managed to master the Cosmos stack in a short period. I'm happy to keep supporting your efforts and the Laurel Project's.
  > Sat, Apr 30, 2022, by [@fedekunze](https://github.com/fedekunze)
  * [https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/4](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/4)
  > ACK. I cannot comment on the number of hours spent since can't verify that, but I can confirm the output of the volunteering effort on Evmos and Ethermint.
  > Federico Kunze Küllmer - Evmos
  > Tue, Jun 14, 2022, by [@fedekunze](https://github.com/fedekunze)
but he recently deleted that comment (he deleted all his public confirmations of my volunteering).
  * Other confirmations from Tharsis at [https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/5](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/5), [https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/6](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/6), [https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/7](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/7)

* 4. The proof that this chain accepts claims for retroactive public goods is [proposal 88](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/88).

## Retroactive Payment

372 + 391.3 + 376 + 26 + 3.5 + 524 + 313 + 290 + 304 = 2599.8

* 2599.8h * 255 EUR/h = 662,949 EUR
* current price: TBD EUR/ $EVMOS

Total: TBD $EVMOS

## The Meaning of the Decision

* 1. If this proposal passes: the Evmos chain pays retroactively for this public good.
* 2. If this proposal does not pass: the Evmos chain recognizes in perpetuity this public good as a volunteering effort of The Laurel Project in the interest of the Evmos Community. (or is bound to produce counter-proofs to the ones above). The presented effort was made with the intent of being offered to the Evmos Community as a volunteer effort. The legitimate repayment for volunteer effort is the recognition of said effort. 
* 3. No with veto: the chain benefits from and uses this free, unpaid effort, but it has decided to punish the author of this effort, for requesting formal recognition of the volunteered effort.
