# Aspiration: Consciouness Is Good

## Precedence

- [The Principle Of Existence Of Aspirations](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/PrincipleOfExistenceOfAspirations.md)

## Exposition

[Consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) is existence, expirience, and awareness. Past awareness is the pre-requisite for recall, therefore for knowledge.
More awareness is better than less if the ability to filter and pattern-select exists.

## Rules

1. Consciousness exists.
2. Consciouness is good. More consciousness is better then less.
3. Recall is ability to access past consciousness.
4. Patterns exist within consciousness.
5. Patterns can be used to select, filter, focus, defocus, navigate and describe the awareness and have correspondences in Concepts and Words.
6. Isolation/definitions of patterns and their diversification and countabily increase consciousness.
7. Transparency and access to primary (unadulterated) data increases chances for new consciousness (definition of new patterns or discovery of new counts of known patterns).
8. Transparency increases when capacity to pattern-filter data exists.
