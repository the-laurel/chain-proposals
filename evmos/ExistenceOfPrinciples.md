# The Existence of Principles

## Precedence

- Basic Rules

## Exposition

[A principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle) is a proposition or value that is a guide for behavior or evaluation. It is definable, atemporal, generally valid. Its application to circumstance should be computable.

This first principle is axiomatic and proposes the existence of principles (including itself).

## Rules

1. Principles exist.
2. Some principles are axioms (cannot be deduced from priors)
3. Principles are:
    1. definable
    2. perpetual
    3. unrestricted by space
    4. generalized: unrestricted by a specific domain
    5. deterministic: their application is the same under the same circumstances
