# Consensus on Precedence

This proposal recognizes as precedent:
1. [Consensus on Words and Concepts](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6610-metameta-consensus-on-words-and-concepts)

## Exposition

We perceive time as the axis that imparts causal ordering. Causes cannot appear before their effects. This is the context of understanding the meaning of "precedence" here. It means not merely acceptance of conformance to previous decisions, but, more importantly, the acceptance of causal dependence upon them.
As a language cannot exist without the underlying links between the concepts each of its words evokes, the same way governance decisions are not complete without formally-accepted links in the governance precedence graph.
Any new proposal should accept the fact that it is based on the previous consensus and it cannot exist without the causal precedence relations. At the minimum, it uses words and concepts and that means accepting that words and concepts are a cache of consensus and that the new proposal is basing itself on the extant relationship between the concepts it mentions. Therefore the new proposal is accepting the previous decision about consensus on words and concepts.

## Rules

1. New proposals have to honor causal precedence by mentioning (like this proposal does) the previous consensus they use for their understanding. In cases where the proposal does not mention the minimal precedence, all its members have the duty to vote "No with Veto".
2. The minimum consensus that may be mentioned is [Consensus on Words and Concepts]([https://hackmd.io/jBPSBDMgQRC3W9e3VWTpKQ](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6610-metameta-consensus-on-words-and-concepts))
3. A set of passed proposals may be used together and get a name, to better abstract their causal subgraph and their consequences.
4. Any proposal that passes may be used as an argument and/or precedence for future proposals.
5. If proposal B, which can be understood as a causal consequence of proposal A, does not pass (especially with a veto), it may constitute precedence for amending the decision for proposal A.
6. A governing community may restrict proposals to those that mention a named set (point 3) as minimal precedence (or amendments of the said set based on consensus on words and concepts).

## Consequences

1. If a governing community defines the set mentioned at points (3) and (6), the set can be named "Constitution", "Covenant", "Manifesto", etc. of the said community.
