# Governance Infrastructure

discussion: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6708-metameta-governance-infrastructure

## Precedence

- The Cosmos SDK

## Acknowledgement

All governance proposals are accepting the technical features and limitations of:

- The Cosmos SDK gov module running on this chain:
  - v0.45.5
  - https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/gov
  - https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/gov/spec/README.md
- the gov module parameters that are in force on this chain at the moment of the proposal being committed to the chain

## Rules

1. No proposal will impose outcomes that are impossible to achieve with the present governance infrastructure.
