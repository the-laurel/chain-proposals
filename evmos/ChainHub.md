# ChainHub Proposals

## Commonwealth Posts

### [Honorable validators,](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7105-incubation-proposal-from-chainhub?comment=30931)

I invite you to an exercise: Let us imagine in extremis that none of the projects incubated at ChainHub will have success. It would seem that Evmos has not invested well the $1M asked by this proposal. But here I would disagree for the following reasons:

1. The funds will remain our signal from the Evmos Community that we welcome collaboration with academia and we have new knowledge (beyond Ethereum) for the students to learn
1. New developers and opinion leaders from select sources (reputable education institutions) are welcome and incentivized to collaborate with us
1. We set a new standard for smart contract development: with people who are willing to share their real identities and risk their careers at this moment: Professor Sriram Vishwanath and 4 named students
1. By putting in a big enough amount of money, you guarantee that students will find out about this opportunity. Only ChainHub itself has ~300 student members. Don’t forget that Evmos itself has had a very generous start: the rekt drop. Many people received $EVMOS as a gift, without doing any effort for the network. And it turns out, this was a very good marketing decision.
1. In principle we are generous: we are willing to pay forward when collaborating with established institutions, thus acting as a civilizing factor in the blockchain space

Other people who aspire to become pillars of society pay millions of dollars to have their names sculpted on these academic buildings. They are paying mostly to the administrative organs of the institutions. Evmos here has the unique chance to pay directly the active actors: professors and students. And the record of such charity will remain inscribed on a more enduring medium than buildings: the Evmos blockchain.

We should not think that we pay for the projects. We create a signal of trust and honor from us (as an institution) to other reputable educational institutions.

### [Evmos stakers,](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7105-incubation-proposal-from-chainhub?comment=30978)

By your vote on https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/69, you will decide much more than what is proposed on the surface. I want simply to remind you of some facts:

1. Since May of 2022 (~130 days ago), this chain delivers profits to stakers
2. Evmos chain has a market cap of $550,458,000 ATM
3. The tech in use by Evmos was developed also by external actors (Cosmos SDK and geth)
4. Those actors were not paid for the goods they have produced
5. Evmos stakers have judged with a different standard when Kava (and maybe other chains) begin to use Ethermint (that is in the care of Evmos)

6. The stakers in Evmos do not do any charity through the institution of the chain and they offer no support for academia (yet)

In other words: by voting "No" on proposals that would bring some balance to this state of affairs, Evmos stakers want for themselves to gain by opportunity while forcing others to gain at the market margin or worse (to even lose as geth does). That is the very definition of being grabbing.

With this behavior of Evmos (that is the same as a pest in the animal order), Loredana is sent to Kava to expose their ethical problems (of the same nature). With this behavior, you want volunteers and young developers to continue to be inspired by Evmos.

With this vote, you will probably decide the legacy of Evmos: that is how it will be remembered after the chain halts (and that is guaranteed before the death of the universe). Or maybe the "legacy" will be only the profits in our pockets and the fight to steal more from each other.

Decide you do.
