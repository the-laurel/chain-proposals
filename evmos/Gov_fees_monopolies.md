# Fee rewards for functional monopolies not source-invented by deployer should go to the Community Pool

https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/4966-fee-rewards-for-functional-monopolies-not-sourceinvented-by-deployer-should-go-to-the-community-pool

When the fee rewards feature will be activated, contract deployers will receive a share from the transaction fees paid by the users of the contract.

The fee rewards target developers who do not have resources, but can bring innovation (source-invention) to Evmos.

For functional monopoly contracts that are not source-invented by their deployers, these fee rewards should go to the Community Pool. 
This is the first governance proposal to replenish Community Pool funds and make the innovation grants sustainable in the long term.

This discussion sets the ethical base of this issue. If the Evmos community supports it, a follow up discussion on technical aspects will be done.

## Concepts

### Functional monopoly

The implementation of a standard that everybody has to agree to follow in order for a specific functionality to survive in a decentralized environment. E.g. the WETH (wrapped ETH) smart contract, or other ERC20 token contracts.

### Source-invented

You are source-inventor if you have ability to prove source code implementation as your own original idea. (Eg: by github repo).

## Additional considerations

I am keeping this proposal simple. 
But there are other possible sources of income for the Commonwealth (Community Pool), that I have written about here https://github.com/the-laurel/governance/blob/7b4faf8cc24b3a41a5dbc9ec9605d2c19d995e5c/docs/EthicsOfTheCommonwealth.md.
