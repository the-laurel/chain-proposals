# A Decentralized Chain is an Independent Entity

A decentralized chain is the first artificial life that humans have created. It was created to be an independent entity, capable of making decisions with the purpose of surviving and thriving.

An independent entity:
- does not owe anything to anyone
- has a sense making aparatus, for gathering data
- has a decision making aparatus, for taking decisions based on available data
- has an executive aparatus, for executing approved decisions
- has a body capable of all the above, which needs to be maintained in good shape
- has dreams and aspirations concerning its existence

## Bodies

As such, we determine the following independent but intercorrelated bodies:
1. Chain Aspirations Body 
2. Decision-Making Body
3. Executive Body
4. Sense-Making Body
5. Building and Maintenance Body


### 1. Chain Aspirations Body 

Members: all who demonstrated vision for Evmos, who have a strong proof that their vision was correct and beneficial for Evmos. Awarded by the Decision-Making Body after the proofs exist. High honorary title.

Responsibilities:
- set and make public the highest aspirations for the chain
- find and review proposed candidates that deserve membership in the Aspirations Body
- oversee the aligning with these aspirations of the Decision-Making Body
- oversee the enforcing of these aspirations in the Executive Body

Rights:
- the right to VETO any decision from the Decision-Making Body

Members: first members are the chain's founders. The existence of the chain is proof that they have vision for the chain.

### 2. Decision-Making Body

Contains all those who hold $EVMOS. The more $EVMOS you hold, the higher the official position you can aspire to. 

Responsibilities:
- analyse and decide on proposals with integrity of context
- reject proposals without integrity of context
- for office holders: escrow an amount of $EVMOS directly dependent on your voting power percentage, for damage repayment of stakeholders in case your decision was proven wrong.

### 3. Executive Body

Responsibilities:
- assign and oversee execution of decisions made by the Decision-Making Body
- implement decisions at code level

### 4. Sense-Making Body

Responsibilities:
- ensure integrity (completeness or context) of information for any decision taken by the Decision-Making Body
- fact-checking for all information used for decision-making
- ensure transparency of the above information for stakeholders
- ensure feedback from stakeholders is registered and available to all stakeholders

### 5. Building and Maintenance Body

Responsibilities:
- keep the chain's electronic body functioning properly
- implement decisions at hardware/validator level
- implement decisions from the Executive Body



## A Dependent Chain

Anything less than independence creates and invites distrust, which leads to volatility, unfairness and scams.

A chain cannot be decentralized if it starts with:
- dues owned to 3rd party actors
- unclarity of ownership and hierarchy of ownership
- unclarity on the amount/magnitude of funds being owned by parties involved in the chain's creation 
- unclarity of intelectual property owed


## Consequences for Evmos

Evmos should not elect members in offices unless previous dues are solved:
- [Olympus Mons Testnet](https://medium.com/evmos/announcing-olympus-mons-evmos-incentivized-testnet-46fa24270a25)
- any promises that the Evmos Foundation or Evmos team has made to any stakeholders or validators
- payments for LPX, GV, Benny Lava
- payments for moderators
- transparency on who received $EVMOS at genesis time, to be able to determine the Evmos chain dues.
- reward software that Evmos has used.
- TBD if any

Inspired by biology principles and Christian Tzurcanu's [work for The Laurel Project](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/tree/main/evmos), I tried to compress and customize a vision for Evmos.

I am a volunteer, I owe allegiance to nobody. At the same time, the volunteer foundation that I am building has 1.4M $EVMOS staked.

I was elected by vote in the Evmos Interchain Pact Office [Evmos Governance proposal #45](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/45), I have been contributing to core development for Evmos and Ethermint (code, prototypes, innovations, video demos, governance, wallet) as a volunteer from The Laurel Project (unpaid, self-funded, from the heart), with more than 100h/week. Detailed contributions [here](https://evolve.provable.dev/).
