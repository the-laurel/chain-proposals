# Governance Consensus: Governance Immunity

Discussion: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/105rrn1/governance_consensus_governance_immunity_evmos/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/105rrn1/governance_consensus_governance_immunity_evmos/)

## Exposition

In order to separate the governance process from levers of power that may delegitimize it, we propose a governance immunity for the active validators.

## Measures
### 1. Validators shall not be obstructed from doing their governance duties:
#### __1.1. vote in Governance
#### __1.2. create on-chain Proposals
#### __1.3. perform their duty to follow the governance process according to [prop #83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83) or updated versions
##### ____1.3.1. create/edit their own proposals as discussions
##### ____1.3.2. comment on other proposals being discussed
##### ____1.3.3. answer to comments
### 2. While any active validator is banned or otherwise obstructed: no governance action should be performed save what is necessary to remedy this situation

## Meaning of the Decision

* if this proposal passes: the governance will be able to protect itself from outside interference
* if this proposal does not pass: any validator may be eliminated from the discussion or/and access to governance by off-chain means

Only the chains that will pass proposals compatible with this one will have the legitimacy to enter common governance platforms for the InterChain.
