# Rewarding Past Go-Ethereum Development Efforts 

_(a similar one to be done for Cosmos SDK)_

This is an inter-chain diplomacy proposal for the Evmos Community to reward the creators and maintainers of the [go-ethereum library](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) for past development efforts. go-ethereum is used by [Ethermint](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint). 

Amount in $EVMOS: 0.5M-2M TBD in Evmos Commonwealth.

Distribution: TBD (similar to Evmos grants, open to other suggestions).

## Summary of Facts

- go-ethereum is the de-facto library that implements the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
- currently, 516 chains use EVM: https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains/tree/master/_data/chains
- as far as I am aware, there are no official proposals from other chains' communities to reward the go-ethereum team for their work. 


## What Does Evmos Stand to Gain?

Evmos has the opportunity to lead by example and establish a mode of collaboration that does not exist yet between chains, by rewarding the effort that has made Evmos itself possible - from go-ethereum, Cosmos SDK, to enriching the blockchain research space, by creating a [Blockchain Classification System for Research Topics](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7020-blockchain-classification-system-bcs-for-research-topics)

With funding, development effort or both.

This approach solidifies the standing that Evmos has to protect innovations that are built by its community members, and make sure they are rewarded apropriately within the larger blockchain ecosystem.

## Proposal Lead

I have been volunteering for Ethereum since 2018. My contribution is described in detail [here](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/master/Ethereum.md) - I am an author of EIPs, a functional language for EVM: Taylor, a visual language for EVM: Pipeline, presented at conferences and many other projects in the Ethereum space.

In Evmos, I was elected by vote in the Evmos Interchain Office [Evmos Governance proposal #45](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/45) and I have been contributing to Evmos (code, prototypes, innovations, video demos, governance) as a volunteer from The Laurel Project. Detailed contributions [here](https://evolve.provable.dev/). 

This proposal is made from a volunteer capacity (independent, unpaid, self-funded, and from the heart).
