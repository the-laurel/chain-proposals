# Governance Consensus: No Criminal Decisions

The context is https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/1032ehn/how_to_centralize_a_chain_by_manipulating_cosmos/. This thread is intended as a public discussion space for the proposal below, brought to Evmos Governance.

Previous discussion: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8616-governance-consensus-only-legal-decisions (today my CommonWealth account was banned, therefore this Reddit thread is the discussion)

## Rules

The Evmos chain shall pass only decisions that are not criminal according to Criminal Law. By the Criminal Law we understand the criminal code covered by International Law, Federal Law, EU Law, and the laws of the countries, states, and lands that have jurisdiction over the $EVMOS token holders.

## Meaning of the Decision

- if this proposal passes: the governance gains additional legitimacy by recognizing the rule of law
- if this proposal does not pass: the chain signals its disregard for the laws of the land and eventual premeditation to break the Criminal Law

Only the chains that will pass proposals compatible with this one will have the legitimacy to enter common governance platforms for the InterChain. By this prop, we offered Evmos yet another opportunity to be the early leader in that respect.
