# About Evmos Commonwealth

I made the [dTypeDB proposal](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/4980-dtypedb-the-first-interchain-database) faster than I initially wanted. Because I do not like to offer criticism without it being constructive.

I was seeing proposals being made to the Evmos Commonwealth that proposed to use Community Pool money for unclear benefits. I am referring to conferences and hackathons. Evmos, at this point, does not have its killer usecase that no other chain has, to inspire developers to dream at these conferences about what can be done and inspire high quality hackathon submissions.

Evmos should not want to pay from its community's pocket for projects that can easily be done on other platforms, like Ethereum or even other Cosmos-EVM chains. It should prioritize use cases that can only be done on Evmos.

And I have done my duty to show how Evmos can shine among all these other chains. dTypeDB is only one of them. For example, the Evmos founders already know about our design that aggregates some of my past prototype videos into a native rollup-sharding solution for Evmos. But even for that idea, dTypeDB is the base layer.

The Evmos token (its current perceived value of ~$1.50 for a cap of 204M) is not strong enough now to support grants or proposals with unclear outcome or outcome that does not differentiate Evmos from other chains.
We need to first explore and demonstrate what is Evmos's best value proposition.

And this is not just an opinion. It is a conclusion based on experience: Bitcoin and Ethereum attracted talent through tech that was new and exciting. The flashy conferences came after they had a good product, after they had money. 
How about don't spend anything on usecase that are not unique to Evmos's value propositions until Evmos is 50$? Force the proposers to think about Evmos first.

Having hackathons and supporting conferences are mimetic behaviors. All chains do that now.

So, I leave you with a Peter Thiel quote:

Don't FOMO. Cause FOMO.
