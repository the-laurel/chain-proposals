# The Principle Of Existence Of Aspirations

## Precedence

- [The Principle Of Existence Of Principles](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/a0d41eb237980598343f46fe02e5c74840f9b79b/evmos/ExistenceOfPrinciples.md)

## Exposition

Aspirations are propositions that may be proven, unproven, or even apparently false, but acting as though they are true in principle, confers the actor an evolutionary advantage.

Some examples: "In God we trust.", "Humans are essentially good", "Life is good.".

## Rules

1. Aspirations exist.
2. Aspirations have the following attributes:
    1. optional: not necessary for survival or normal functioning
    2. if communal: reached by (proven) continuous consensus
3. A community is defined by its common aspirations:
    1. acceptance of new members means their formal acceptance of the community's aspirations
    2. exclusions from the community can be a reflex to rejection of common aspirations
