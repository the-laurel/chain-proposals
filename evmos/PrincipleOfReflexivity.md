# The Principle of Reflexivity/Symmetry

## Precedence

- [The Existence of (Governance) Principles](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/ExistenceOfPrinciples.md)

## Exposition

The same principle is instantiated as "the law of action and reaction" in Physics, "the law of karma" in Hinduism, [lex talionis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_for_an_eye), etc.
Any action that happens to have entity A as subject and B as an object is created (causally) accompanied by a reaction that has B as subject and A as an object.
We call the initiatory action "a cause" and the reaction "an effect".

## Rules

1. A reaction has only one action as its causal precedence is a reflex.
2. A reaction that has additional precedence (than the momentary cause) is not reflexive and involves responsibility (produces additional merit or demerit).
3. All involved parties (active and reactive) in a proposal have to be mentioned and their role recognized.
4. All proposals have to contain a link to the discussion and the discussion should contain the point of view of all roles (eg.: active, reactive)

## Obvious Applications

- application of justice
- determination of completeness
- audiatur et altera pars (listen to the other side)
