## A Note From The Initial Author

I, Christian Tzurcanu, have been working on this governance framework for several months already under the auspices of The Laurel Project and for the future governance on the Logos chain. I know that these texts may be too formal for the Evmos Community, but they constitute my volunteer effort and my sincere belief that governance needs clarity, modularity, and simplicity. And that the community will make a greater effort now to understand this design, but will benefit in the long run and (why not?) become a model of governance for the entire Cosmos.

However, I do not want to be perceived as harassing: I will continue to share and propose such work to Evmos only if the community will appreciate the benefit of having this system. So this proposal has also a voting poll besides the discussion. Maybe even an on-chain proposal for the entire eneterprise.

## Exposition

These are the rules necessary for informed governance that acknowledges prior consensus and the limitations of present infrastructure.

This is a collation proposal to name the decisions mentioned in "Precedence" as the name of this proposal. It is done for ease of use and clarity of the future proposal precedence section: instead of mentioning the 2 decisions above by name, they will be referred to by: "Basic Rules".

By having these Basic Rules, we are in the position to define, compose, enforce, and hygienically amend a Constitution.

Namely, conform to the Precedence rules number 3 and 6:
```
A Constitution for a community is the named set of rules (accepted proposals) that are required of any new proposal to be mentioned as precedence in their description.
```
