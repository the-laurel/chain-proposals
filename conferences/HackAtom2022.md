## Trailblazing the Inter-Chain
_A practical guide for modifying EVM standards like ERC20, ERC721, etc. so they work in a IBC universe._

Optional preliminaries: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL323JufuD9JCrElzoheW-oJMujGjHtp-k
Be ready to program the Solidity interfaces for a generalized IBC bridge. You will learn the rules for changing any one-chain standard contract into a multi-chain standard. Then share with others your discoveries in after-thon virtual interactions.
